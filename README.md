# Compiler Optimization

This repository contains my coursework for the 4th Year [Compiler Optimization](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/copt) course, taken in 2011/2012. The coursework focused around evaluating random search as a method for selecting compiler optimizations on a per-program basis.

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
